# KasPump Production Status

## Executive Summary
- **Launch readiness:** ~30%. The repository contains UI scaffolding and draft smart contracts, but critical backend, contract, and data integration work remains incomplete.
- **Blockers:** Neither factory contract compiles cleanly alongside the bonding curve, the AMM cannot dispense tokens, and the frontend/API layers still rely on placeholder data.
- **Recommendation:** Treat the codebase as an early prototype. Prioritize stabilizing the smart contracts, wiring real blockchain data, and hardening the trading flow before considering any release milestones.

## What Is Solid
- ✅ Next.js 14 app shell with Tailwind-based component library and wallet hook stubs.
- ✅ Draft Solidity contracts outlining the intended factory/AMM architecture.
- ✅ Initial analytics and partnership integration scaffolding (non-functional placeholders noted below).

## Critical Gaps (Must Address Before Production)
1. **Fix Solidity build blockers** – Rename the enhanced factory contract, align constructor signatures, and write migrations/tests to ensure all contracts deploy and interoperate. The current sources fail to compile together and would strand user funds.
2. **Fund and secure the AMM** – Ensure the bonding curve contract actually holds/mints inventory, add access control on graduation paths, and introduce reentrancy protection around external token/KAS transfers.
3. **Replace mock integrations** – Home page, analytics API, and partnership modules still return hard-coded or random data. Integrate on-chain reads, remove randomness, and guard external fetches.
4. **Establish error handling & telemetry** – Surface contract/API failures to the UI, add logging/monitoring destinations, and define recovery paths for degraded services.

## High Priority Follow-Ups
- Wire AMM discovery across the app using a single verified source and cache invalidation policy.
- Build real trading flows (quotes, approvals, buy/sell submission, receipt handling) with test coverage.
- Stand up reliable analytics storage instead of in-memory event buffers; define retention and privacy requirements.
- Perform comprehensive wallet QA (connection lifecycle, network mismatch handling, balance refresh scheduling).

## Medium Priority Enhancements
- File upload pipeline for token imagery (IPFS/S3) with validation and moderation hooks.
- Formalize partnership automation after core trading is live.
- Accessibility, SEO, and mobile polish passes once dynamic data is in place.

## Next Steps
1. Audit and patch the Solidity contracts, accompanied by Hardhat/Foundry tests.
2. Implement end-to-end token lifecycle in a testnet environment (creation → trading → graduation).
3. Replace all placeholder data flows with deterministic on-chain queries or indexed services.
4. Add regression test suites (unit + integration) and continuous integration gates.

## Testing Status
- ❌ Automated tests are not configured or running; establish test infrastructure before feature expansion.
