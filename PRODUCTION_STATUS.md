- [ ] **Trading Interface** - Complete buy/sell functionality

### 🟡 High Priority (Should fix soon)
- [ ] **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time price updates
- [ ] **Error Boundaries** - React error boundaries for graceful failures  
- [ ] **Toast Notifications** - User feedback for all actions
- [ ] **Mobile Testing** - Comprehensive mobile responsive testing

### 🟢 Low Priority (Nice to have)
- [ ] **Unit Testing** - Vitest setup and test coverage
- [ ] **Analytics** - User behavior tracking and monitoring
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Bundle splitting and lazy loading

❌ Mock data needs blockchain integration  
❌ Real trading functionality incomplete  

## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Deploy contracts to testnet** - `npm run deploy`
2. **Fix AMM address resolution** - Update contract hooks
3. **Test token creation end-to-end** - Create real tokens
4. **Implement trading functionality** - Complete buy/sell flows
5. **Add real-time data** - WebSocket price feeds
6. **Production testing** - Comprehensive testing on mainnet

## 📝 Notes
