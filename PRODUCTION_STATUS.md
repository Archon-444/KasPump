# KasPump Production Status

## Executive Summary
- **Launch readiness:** ~40%. Core contracts now compile together, the bonding-curve AMM is funded and guarded, and the frontend consumes deterministic API responses, but end-to-end validation and live data remain outstanding.
- **Blockers:** Contract changes require a redeploy/test plan, indexer connectivity is not yet provisioned (APIs return 503 until configured), and trading UX is still missing transaction wiring.
- **Recommendation:** Follow the remediation roadmap: finish contract/regression testing, stand up the indexer service, and complete trading/integration flows before announcing a beta.

## What Is Solid
- ✅ Next.js 14 app shell with Tailwind-based component library and wallet hook stubs.
- ✅ Solidity suite compiles with distinct `TokenFactory` and `EnhancedTokenFactory` contracts plus reentrancy-hardened bonding curve funding its own inventory.
- ✅ Initial analytics and partnership integration scaffolding with buffered event delivery and a remediation plan capturing outstanding work.

## Critical Gaps (Must Address Before Production)
1. **Validate and migrate contract upgrades** – Run Hardhat/Foundry suites, update deployment scripts, and plan liquidity migrations so the new factories and AMM roll out safely.
2. **Provision the indexer + data plane** – APIs now fail fast without `KASPUMP_INDEXER_URL`; stand up the indexer service, backfill historical data, and add health checks.
3. **Finish trading flows and UX protections** – Implement buy/sell transaction handling, approval flows, and error surfaces across desktop/mobile experiences.
4. **Establish error handling & telemetry** – Wire client/server logging destinations, alerting, and disaster-recovery steps once live data lands.

## High Priority Follow-Ups
- Wire AMM discovery across the app using a single verified source and cache invalidation policy.
- Build real trading flows (quotes, approvals, buy/sell submission, receipt handling) with test coverage.
- Stand up reliable analytics storage (backend queue/database) to complement the improved client buffer; define retention and privacy requirements.
- Perform comprehensive wallet QA (connection lifecycle, network mismatch handling, balance refresh scheduling).

## Medium Priority Enhancements
- File upload pipeline for token imagery (IPFS/S3) with validation and moderation hooks.
- Formalize partnership automation after core trading is live.
- Accessibility, SEO, and mobile polish passes once dynamic data is in place.

## Next Steps
1. Audit and patch the Solidity contracts, accompanied by Hardhat/Foundry tests.
2. Implement end-to-end token lifecycle in a testnet environment (creation → trading → graduation).
3. Replace all placeholder data flows with deterministic on-chain queries or indexed services.
4. Add regression test suites (unit + integration) and continuous integration gates.

## Testing Status
- ❌ Automated tests are not configured or running; establish test infrastructure before feature expansion.
