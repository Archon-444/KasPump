## üìã Deployment Prerequisites

### 1. Get Testnet Funds

**Your Wallet Address:** `0x9dbE4D3eB9C592361c57F3346e9FA5cCf3Bde17C`

#### BSC Testnet BNB
- **Faucet:** https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
- **Amount Needed:** ~0.5 BNB (for multiple deployments)
- **Network:** BNB Smart Chain Testnet (Chain ID: 97)

#### Arbitrum Sepolia ETH
- **Faucet:** https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia
- **Amount Needed:** ~0.1 ETH
- **Network:** Arbitrum Sepolia (Chain ID: 421614)

#### Base Sepolia ETH
- **Faucet:** https://faucet.quicknode.com/base/sepolia
- **Amount Needed:** ~0.1 ETH
- **Network:** Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)

### 2. Verify Environment Variables

Check that `.env.local` contains your private key:
```bash
grep PRIVATE_KEY .env.local
```

Should show:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=0x4863bb7bac692cc1717920346784f774159c4a30315f01c9c380d9693a59a554
```

### 3. Compile Contracts (Once Network Access Available)

```bash
# This will download Solidity 0.8.20 compiler
npm run compile

# Expected output:
# Compiled 12 Solidity files successfully
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Strategy: Deterministic Deployment

We're using CREATE2 to ensure **identical contract addresses** across all chains. This provides:
- Simplified user experience (same address everywhere)
- Brand consistency
- Easy verification
- Professional appearance

### Phase 1: Deploy to BSC Testnet (First)

```bash
npm run deploy:deterministic:bsc-testnet
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üî∑ DETERMINISTIC MULTI-CHAIN DEPLOYMENT üî∑

Network: bscTestnet (Chain ID: 97)
Deployer: 0x7918c8840202eac8A490499065Cb6C850d52BBc7

üì¶ Step 1: Deploying DeterministicDeployer...
‚úÖ DeterministicDeployer deployed to: 0x[ADDRESS]

üéØ Step 2: Computing deterministic addresses...
Expected TokenFactory address: 0x[DETERMINISTIC_ADDRESS]
   This address will be IDENTICAL on all chains!

üè≠ Step 3: Deploying TokenFactory via CREATE2...
‚úÖ TokenFactory deployed to: 0x[DETERMINISTIC_ADDRESS]

‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!
```

**IMPORTANT:** Save the TokenFactory address - it will be the same on all chains!

### Phase 2: Deploy to Arbitrum Sepolia

```bash
npm run deploy:deterministic:arbitrum-sepolia
```

**Verification Point:** The TokenFactory address should be **IDENTICAL** to BSC testnet.

### Phase 3: Deploy to Base Sepolia

```bash
npm run deploy:deterministic:base-sepolia
```

**Verification Point:** The TokenFactory address should be **IDENTICAL** to BSC and Arbitrum.

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Verify Identical Addresses

```bash
# Check deployment addresses file (auto-generated)
cat deployments/testnet-addresses.json
```

Expected structure:
```json
{
  "bscTestnet": {
    "deterministicDeployer": "0x[UNIQUE_PER_CHAIN]",
    "tokenFactory": "0x[SAME_ACROSS_ALL_CHAINS]",
    "deployedAt": "2025-10-30T..."
  },
  "arbitrumSepolia": {
    "deterministicDeployer": "0x[UNIQUE_PER_CHAIN]",
    "tokenFactory": "0x[SAME_ACROSS_ALL_CHAINS]",  // ‚Üê VERIFY THIS MATCHES
    "deployedAt": "2025-10-30T..."
  },
  "baseSepolia": {
    "deterministicDeployer": "0x[UNIQUE_PER_CHAIN]",
    "tokenFactory": "0x[SAME_ACROSS_ALL_CHAINS]",  // ‚Üê VERIFY THIS MATCHES
    "deployedAt": "2025-10-30T..."
  }
}
```

### 2. Verify Contract Code on Block Explorers

#### BSC Testnet
- **Explorer:** https://testnet.bscscan.com/
- Navigate to TokenFactory address
- Click "Contract" tab ‚Üí "Verify and Publish"
- Upload flattened source code

#### Arbitrum Sepolia
- **Explorer:** https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/
- Same verification process

#### Base Sepolia
- **Explorer:** https://sepolia.basescan.org/
- Same verification process

## üß™ Functional Testing

### Test 1: Create a Token

```bash
# Run interactive test script
npm run test:create-token
```

Or manually via frontend:
1. Connect wallet to BSC Testnet
2. Navigate to "Create Token" page
3. Fill in token details:
   - Name: "Test Token"
   - Symbol: "TEST"
   - Total Supply: 1,000,000
   - Base Price: 0.0001 BNB
   - Curve: Linear
4. Pay creation fee (0.01 BNB for Basic tier)
5. Verify token is created

### Test 2: Buy Tokens

1. Navigate to newly created token page
2. Enter buy amount (e.g., 0.1 BNB)
3. Click "Buy"
4. Verify:
   - Transaction succeeds
   - Tokens received in wallet
   - Price increased (bonding curve working)
   - MEV protection active (check console logs)

### Test 3: Sell Tokens

1. Enter sell amount
2. Click "Sell"
3. Verify:
   - Tokens deducted from wallet
   - BNB received
   - Price decreased appropriately

### Test 4: Cross-Chain Consistency

1. Deploy token on Arbitrum Sepolia
2. Compare TokenFactory addresses
3. Verify identical behavior across chains

### Test 5: Security Features

**Pause Mechanism:**
```bash
# From contract owner account
tokenFactory.pause()
# Try to create token - should revert
tokenFactory.unpause()
```

**Reentrancy Protection:**
- Already built-in with OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard
- No manual testing needed

**Slippage Protection:**
- Set max slippage to 0.1%
- Try large trade - should revert if price impact > 0.1%

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-Time Monitoring

The deployment script will output:
- Gas used per deployment
- Contract sizes
- Deployment costs

### Expected Gas Costs (Testnet)

| Contract | BSC Testnet | Arbitrum Sepolia | Base Sepolia |
|----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| DeterministicDeployer | ~500k gas (~0.001 BNB) | ~500k gas (~0.0001 ETH) | ~500k gas (~0.0001 ETH) |
| TokenFactory | ~3M gas (~0.006 BNB) | ~3M gas (~0.0003 ETH) | ~3M gas (~0.0003 ETH) |
| **Total per chain** | **~0.007 BNB** | **~0.0004 ETH** | **~0.0004 ETH** |

### Block Explorer Verification URLs

After deployment, verify contracts at:
- BSC Testnet: `https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/[FACTORY_ADDRESS]`
- Arbitrum Sepolia: `https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/[FACTORY_ADDRESS]`
- Base Sepolia: `https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/[FACTORY_ADDRESS]`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Compiler Download Fails

**Error:** `HH502: Couldn't download compiler version list`

**Solution:**
1. Check network connectivity:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://binaries.soliditylang.org/linux-amd64/list.json
   ```
2. Try alternative DNS:
   ```bash
   # Temporarily use Google DNS
   export DNS_NAMESERVER=8.8.8.8
   ```
3. Wait for network access restrictions to be lifted

### Issue: Deployment Fails with "Insufficient Funds"

**Solution:**
1. Check testnet balance:
   ```bash
   npm run check-balance
   ```
2. Get more testnet funds from faucets (see Prerequisites)

### Issue: Deterministic Addresses Don't Match

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're using the SAME `DEPLOYMENT_SALT` across all chains
2. Check `.env.local` for consistency:
   ```bash
   echo $DEPLOYMENT_SALT
   ```
3. Redeploy with consistent salt

### Issue: Transaction Reverts

**Check common causes:**
1. Slippage too low (increase to 1-2% for testnet)
2. Insufficient token balance
3. Contract paused (check owner status)
4. Gas limit too low (increase to 500k)
